					"Upon gaining expertise with a weapon, improvised attacks made with that weapon are done with proficiency. The damage rolled will be at least 1 damage class lower than the base damage of that weapon. For example, gripping the greatsword by the blade and pummeling someone with the hilt would be an attack with proficiency with a damage roll of 1d10 bludgeoning assuming that character is an expert with a greatsword. Likewise, if that character took a thrusting stance and drove that sword forward to do piercing damage. That damage would be 1d10 piercing damage. The minimum damage roll can be 1d4, but note that not all weapons can be improvised to change damage type. It is based on what would be a logical and reasonable attack. So, a club might not do slashing damage, but it might do piercing if the grip was sharpened at the end. In regards to polearm master, a polearm improvised attack with expertise might deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage while the bonus action attack from the feat would deal 1d4 bludgeoning. Because, the pummel was performed as an improvised action, it gets higher damage dice under this rule."
